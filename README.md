## Features
Visual Indicators:
* ☆ icon is displayed on choices that affect story variables
* ★ icon is displayed on choices that trigger an ending for a character
* *\*end\** is displayed on choices that end the current interaction

Tooltips (two modes that can be switched between by pressing Caps Lock button):
* Concise tooltip - only shown for choices that affect story variables/grant endings (default mode on opening the game)
* Expanded tooltip - shows actual dialogue and next choice options that follows the choice

Both visual indicators and tooltips include all consequences from your choice until the next decision point (includes no-choice and single-choice continuations).

## Notes
* Caps Lock button acts as a toggle regardless of your actual Caps Lock state
* Sometimes tooltips appear a bit bigger than they need to be
* Both tooltip modes contain spoilers to varying degrees
* Mod was not tested on a full playthrough yet
